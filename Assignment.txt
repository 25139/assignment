Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

In JavaScript, a data type defines the type of value that a variable can hold. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means you donâ€™t have to explicitly specify the data type of a variable. The type is determined automatically based on the value assigned.
Types of Data Types in JavaScript
1.	Primitive Data Types
2.	Non-Primitive Data Types
1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types in JavaScript are the most basic types of data. These are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are created.
Primitive Data Types in JavaScript:
Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
let age = 25;      // Integer
let pi = 3.14;     // Floating-point
String: Represents textual data.
let name = "Alice";
Boolean: Represents logical values (true or false).
let isAvailable = true;
Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
let x; // Undefined
Null: Represents an intentional absence of value.
let y = null;










2. Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive (or reference) data types are more complex. They can store collections of values or more complex entities and are mutable.
Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript:
Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25
};
Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of data.
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
Function: A block of reusable code that can be called and executed.
function greet() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}
